iCommunication
==============
Author: Shane (Guigang Zhao)


An app to create a communication. I used KoaJS, AngularJS, MongoDB and NodeJS which together I call it KAMN stack.
I used Jade as html template engine and also used a lot of styles in Bootstrap.

<h3>How to set up and config mongodb</h3>

2. create database "travel"
3. create collection "info", "com", "user"

3. Run the Node with "npm start".
